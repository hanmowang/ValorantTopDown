# Valorant inspired topdown shooter with infinite enemy spawner

This is the first game I made

Combined the two guides ([Wizard top down shooter series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9jRfgjV4FQ&t=1s) and [Let's build a game series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gir2R7G9ws&t=1s)) from RealTutsGML on YouTube.

Inspired by the game VALORANT

# How to launch the game

Download the "download me" file

run the launchGame.bat file to start the game

if nothing happens, try download Java SE [here](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) and try again.

if the game freezes press esc to exit and run the game again.

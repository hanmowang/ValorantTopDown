Combined the two guides (Wizard top down shooter series and Let's build a game series) from RealTutsGML on YouTube.

Inspired by the game VALORANT

Download all the files and put them in the same folder

run the launchGame.bat file to start the game

if nothing happens, try download Java SE at https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html and try again.

if the game freezes press esc to exit and run the game again.

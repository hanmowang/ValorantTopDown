This is the first game I made

Combined the two guides ([Wizard top down shooter series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9jRfgjV4FQ&t=1s) and [Let's build a game series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gir2R7G9ws&t=1s)) from RealTutsGML on YouTube.

Inspired by the game VALORANT

Download all the files and put them in the same folder

run the launchGame.bat file to start the game

if nothing happens, try download Java SE [here](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) and try again.

if the game freezes press esc to exit and run the game again. Sorry about that, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the reason but still failed to do so.

Here is a demo of what the game looks like
